                <p id="text-subsection">A tracheostomy is typically performed in cases of severe respiratory problems, such as when a person cannot maintain a clear airway, has significant airway obstruction, or needs mechanical ventilation for an extended period. It can also be necessary after certain surgeries, injuries, or other medical conditions that affect a person's ability to breathe normally.</p>
